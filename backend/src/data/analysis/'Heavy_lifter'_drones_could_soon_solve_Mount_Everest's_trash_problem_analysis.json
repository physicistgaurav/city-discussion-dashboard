    "topic": "'Heavy lifter' drones could soon solve Mount Everest's trash problem",
    "summary": "The discussions revolve around the potential use of drones to clean up the waste on Mount Everest, particularly at the summit. The main highlight is the intention to use drones to remove the accumulated garbage, which would be a significant achievement. However, there are concerns about the impact on employment, with the possibility that drones may replace some jobs, particularly in the Khumbu Icefall. The plan is to train Sherpas to operate the drones, ensuring that local employment is maintained.",
    "sentiment": "This discussion is neutral as it presents a solution to the issue of waste on Mount Everest, but also addresses concerns about job displacement for Sherpas. The sentiment is balanced, with the potential benefits of using drones for waste removal weighed against the potential impact on employment.",
    "actionable_needs": "1. Clean up of Mount Everest's garbage, particularly at the summit, using drones.\n   - Action: Organize and fund a drone-based cleanup operation to remove waste from Mount Everest's summit.\n\n2. Reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, a dangerous zone.\n   - Action: Implement the use of drones to assist climbers in navigating the Khumbu Icefall, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and fatalities.\n\n3. Training of Sherpas as drone operators for higher camps.\n   - Action: Provide training to Sherpas to operate drones at higher altitudes and take over tasks that cannot be handled by drone operators at base camps."
