    "summary": "Here is a summary of the discussion in 2-3 sentences:\n\nThe discussion focuses on the Crash of the Liberty Bell 2 (CoL) and how it is well-positioned. A key concern is that lightweight aircrafts tend to overrotate if the elevons' maximum deployment is not limited, which can be fixed by adjusting the settings. The conversation also touches on the importance of staying together and near large pieces of wreckage in the event of a crash, as seen in the documentary about the CoL tragedy.",
    "sentiment": "The sentiment of this discussion is generally neutral, with a mix of practical advice and historical commentary, but with a hint of positivity towards the documentary and the search and rescue teams.",
    "actionable_needs": "Here are 2-3 key points that identify actionable needs:\n\n1. **Limit elevon deployment**: To prevent over-rotation, consider limiting the maximum degrees of deployment for lightweight aircraft.\n2. **Improve search and rescue techniques**: Professional search and rescue teams can benefit from training exercises, such as simulating lost person scenarios, to improve their effectiveness.\n3. **Enhance communication and coordination**: In the event of a crash, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the flight path and to coordinate search efforts with those who knew the missing individuals, such as family members or colleagues."
