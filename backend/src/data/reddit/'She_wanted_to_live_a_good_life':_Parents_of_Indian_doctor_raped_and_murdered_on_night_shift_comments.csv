No wonder our country is facing a brain drain in healthcare. It\u2019s not just the Docs, nurses, paramedics are fleeing to other countries as well. Recognise the pattern.",

        "CommentBody": "This incident should be considered beyond the political agenda. A female doctor, working late night in a reputed hospital, getting raped and killed while in shift, nobody knew until her body was discovered. Can you imagine, how horrible the safety situation is! A woman getting raped and killed, that too, not in a secluded place but in a crowded hospital, where patients are coming 24X7, police presence is there always. CCTV camera was deactivated, nobody could be identified till now! Moreover, hospital authority and the political party in power are trying to suppress the news and trying to turn the incident into suicide, trying to victim blame too. Most probably there are some bigshots involved in this heinous crime, whom the government wants to hide! We need to come forward and support the protest, no matter whoever the criminal is, should get maximum punishment. Else women would not feel safe going to work, or getting out of their house, even won't feel safe inside their house too.",

Her mother had called to enquire whether she had dinner. Our daughter said she had brought dinner and would eat it later. She told her mother to have her dinner and go to sleep. Her last words to her mother were \u2018*Aamay* round-*e jete hobe* (I have to be on the ward round),\u2019\u201d the young doctor\u2019s father told this newspaper. \n\nCan someone tell me why the hospital say it was suicide ?",
