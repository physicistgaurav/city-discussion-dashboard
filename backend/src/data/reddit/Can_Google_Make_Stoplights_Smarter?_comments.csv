        "CommentBody": "Looks like it is. I knew it used multi-armed bandit testing for deciding on winning ads, but this is old info.\n\n>  \nWhen you have little to no conversion data available, Smart Bidding can still use query-level data beyond your bid strategy to build more accurate initial conversion rate models. This helps it make more informed bidding decisions from the start. **It then uses Bayesian learning** to continuously improve these models as it accrues conversion rate data at more granular levels (e.g. for a search query mapped to specific ad copy or landing pages).\n\n[https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10970825?hl=en](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10970825?hl=en)",
